# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Equipment Efficiency Comparison Tool is a new feature for the SeeTech Solutions Internal Toolbox that will allow engineers to compare different equipment options side-by-side based on their efficiency metrics, energy consumption, and cost-benefit analysis. This tool will help consultants make data-driven recommendations to clients by providing clear visual comparisons and detailed analysis of various equipment alternatives.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an energy efficiency consultant, I want to compare multiple equipment options side-by-side, so that I can identify the most efficient and cost-effective solution for my client.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the equipment comparison tool THEN the system SHALL display an interface to add multiple equipment items for comparison
2. WHEN the user adds equipment to compare THEN the system SHALL allow selection from the equipment library or manual entry of specifications
3. WHEN comparing equipment THEN the system SHALL support at least 2 and up to 5 equipment items in a single comparison
4. WHEN equipment is selected for comparison THEN the system SHALL display key metrics including energy consumption, efficiency rating, initial cost, and operating cost
5. WHEN viewing a comparison THEN the system SHALL calculate and display the payback period for each equipment option relative to a baseline
6. WHEN comparing equipment THEN the system SHALL provide visual charts showing the differences in energy consumption and cost over time

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an energy efficiency consultant, I want to save and export equipment comparisons, so that I can include them in client proposals and reports.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a comparison is complete THEN the system SHALL provide an option to save the comparison to the project
2. WHEN saving a comparison THEN the system SHALL link it to a specific project if selected
3. WHEN a comparison is saved THEN the system SHALL allow the user to access it later from the project details or a dedicated comparisons section
4. WHEN viewing a saved comparison THEN the system SHALL allow the user to export it as a PDF report
5. WHEN exporting a comparison THEN the system SHALL include all comparison data, charts, and a summary of recommendations
6. WHEN a comparison is exported THEN the system SHALL format it professionally with SeeTech branding

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an energy efficiency consultant, I want to perform lifecycle cost analysis on equipment options, so that I can demonstrate long-term value to clients.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN comparing equipment THEN the system SHALL calculate lifecycle costs over a user-defined period (1-25 years)
2. WHEN performing lifecycle analysis THEN the system SHALL include initial cost, energy costs, maintenance costs, and replacement costs
3. WHEN calculating lifecycle costs THEN the system SHALL allow the user to input or adjust parameters like energy price, inflation rate, and discount rate
4. WHEN viewing lifecycle analysis THEN the system SHALL display a year-by-year breakdown of costs
5. WHEN comparing lifecycle costs THEN the system SHALL calculate and display the net present value (NPV) and internal rate of return (IRR) for each option
6. WHEN viewing lifecycle analysis THEN the system SHALL provide a chart showing cumulative costs over time with the break-even point highlighted

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an energy efficiency consultant, I want to include environmental impact metrics in equipment comparisons, so that I can demonstrate sustainability benefits to clients.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN comparing equipment THEN the system SHALL calculate and display COâ‚‚ emissions reduction compared to the baseline
2. WHEN viewing environmental metrics THEN the system SHALL show equivalent metrics (e.g., trees planted, cars removed from road)
3. WHEN calculating environmental impact THEN the system SHALL use regional carbon intensity factors if available
4. WHEN viewing environmental impact THEN the system SHALL provide visualizations of emissions reduction over the equipment lifecycle
5. WHEN comparing equipment THEN the system SHALL include any applicable environmental certifications or ratings
6. WHEN environmental data is displayed THEN the system SHALL provide options to include this data in exported reports

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to track which equipment recommendations were implemented by clients, so that I can validate actual savings against projections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a comparison is saved THEN the system SHALL allow marking which equipment option was ultimately selected/implemented
2. WHEN an equipment selection is marked as implemented THEN the system SHALL record this in the project history
3. WHEN viewing project details THEN the system SHALL display both projected and actual savings if implementation data is available
4. WHEN actual performance data is entered THEN the system SHALL calculate the variance between projected and actual savings
5. WHEN variance data is available THEN the system SHALL display this information in project reports and dashboards
6. WHEN viewing historical comparisons THEN the system SHALL allow filtering by implemented vs. non-implemented recommendations
